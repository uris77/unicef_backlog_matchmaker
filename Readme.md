# Digital Public Goods Alliance Skills Matchmaker
This is a proof of concept (POC) of a simple matchmaking app based on skills required by projects from the DPGA and 
skills available in a pool of volunteers.

## Structure

This POC is made up of a backend and frontend component. They are built & deployed independently.

The backend provides an API for interacting with the matchmaking engine, and retrieving the results
of a matchmaking "run" from the database. 

The frontend is a minimal React App that interacts with the backend to get a set of projects that
matches a set of skills. The persona for the frontend is any person volunteering their time and skills.
